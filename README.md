threadnos I strated with the intention of experiencing the whole cycle of developement for agile in which I will attempt to fullifil every role by my self.

threadnos is a passion project for me, I started it wanting to write a simple application to record a personal journal, but realized that it doesn't need to be a journal it can be anything notes for a book, a document fo an app, or a light novel.
in essence it's a word editor that lets you save pages in a way similar to threads,
where every page is linked to the previous one

if you are reading this and there is a feature you would like, please do create an issue and I would be happy to oblige if my time allows.
